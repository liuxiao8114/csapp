## Case1: Normalized Values

E = e - Bias
e is the unsigned number having bit representation ek-1...e1e0
Bias is a bias value equal to 2^(k - 1) - 1
B

M = 1 + f
This is sometimes called an implied leading 1 represntation, because we can view M to be

## Case2: Denormalized Values
When the exponent field is all zeros, the represented number is in denormalized form.

E = 1 - Bias <MEMO: means E is fixed in denormalized values>
M = f
