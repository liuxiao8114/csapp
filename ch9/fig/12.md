Physical address


A control register in the CPU, the page table base register (PTBR) points to the current page table.
The n-bit virtual address has two components:
  + a p-bit virtual page offset (VPO)
  + an (n âˆ’ p)-bit virtual page number (VPN)

The MMU uses the VPN to select the appropriate PTE. For example, VPN 0 selects PTE 0, VPN 1 selects PTE 1, and so on.
The corresponding physical address is the concatenation of the physical page number (PPN) from the page table entry and the VPO from the virtual address.
Notice that since the physical and virtual pages are both P bytes, the physical page offset (PPO) is identical to the VPO.
