Practice Problem 9.6 (solution page 919)
Determine the block sizes and header values that would result from the following sequence of malloc requests. Assumptions:
(1) The allocator maintains double-word alignment and uses an implicit free list with the block format from Figure 9.35.
(2) Block sizes are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes.


Request         Block size (decimal bytes)        Block header (hex)
malloc(2)          8(4 + 2 + 2)                       0x0009
malloc(9)         16(4 + 9 + 3)                       0x0011
malloc(15)        24(4 + 15+ 5)                       0x0019
malloc(20)        24(4 + 20+ 0)                       0x0019
