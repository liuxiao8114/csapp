## 6.4.3 Set Associative Caches
The problem with conflict misses in direct-mapped caches stems from the constraint that each set has exact one line(E = 1). A *set associative cache* relaxes this constraint so that each set holds more than one cache line. A cache with 1 < E < C/B is often called an E-way set associative cache.

C = S * E * B
1 < E < C/B
