C = AB


Once the stride reaches eight 8-byte words, which on this system equals the block size of 64 bytes, every read request misses in L2 and must be served from L3. Thus, the read throughput for strides of at least eight is a constant rate determined by the rate that cache blocks can be transferred from L3 into L2.
