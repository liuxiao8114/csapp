### 6.4.5 Issues with Writes
Suppose we write a word w that is already cached(a write hit). After the cache updates its copy of w, What does it do about updating the copy of w in the next lower level of the hierarchy?
The simplest approach, known as write-through, is to immediately write w's cache block to the next lower level.
Another approach, known as write-back, defers the update as long as possible by writing the updated block to the next lower level only when it is evicted form the cache by the replacement algorithm.
Another issue is how to deal with write misses.
Write allocate, loads the corresponding block from the next lower level into the cache and then updates the cache block.
No write allocate, bypasses the cache and writes the word directly to the next lower level.
