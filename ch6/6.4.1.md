### 6.4.1 Generic Cache Memory Organization
Each memory address has m bits form M = 2^m unique address.
A cache for such a machine is organized as an array of  S = 2^s.
Each set consists of E cache lines.
Each line consists of a data block of B = 2^b bytes.
a valid bit that indicates whether or not the line contains meaningful information

t = m - (b + s) tag bits that uniquely identify the block stored in the cache line.

the set index bits tell us which set the word must be stored in.
the t tag bits in A tell us which line(if any) in the set contains the word.
A line in the set contains


a tuple: (S, E, B, m)
S:
E:
B:
m:

data size:
