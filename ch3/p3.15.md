A. What is the target of the je instruction below?
 (You do not need to know anything about the callq instruction here.)

4003fa: 74 02   je XXXXXX
4003fc: ff d0   callq *%rax

0x4003fc + 0x02 = 0x4003fe

B. What is the target of the je instruction below?
40042f: 74 f4   je XXXXXX
400431: 5d      pop %rbp

0x400431 + 0xf4 = 0x400425

C. What is the address of the ja and pop instructions?
XXXXXX: 77 02   ja 400547
XXXXXX: 5d      pop %rbp

pop address: 0x400547 - 0x02 = 0x400545
ja  address: 0x400545 - 0x02 = 0x400543

D. In the code that follows, the jump target is encoded in PC-relative form as a 4-
byte twoâ€™s-complement number. The bytes are listed from least significant to
most, reflecting the little-endian byte ordering of x86-64.What is the address
of the jump target?

4005e8: e9 73 ff ff ff  jmpq XXXXXXX
4005ed: 90              nop

0x4005ed + 0xffffff73 = 0x4005ed - 0x8d = 0x400560
