### 3.7.2 Control Transfer
Passing control from function P to function Q involves simply setting the PC to the starting address of the code in Q. However, when it later comes time for Q to return, the processor must have some record of the code location where it should resume the execution of P.
This information is recorded in x86-64 machines by invoking procedure Q with the instruction *call Q*.
*This instruction pushes an address A onto the stack and sets the PC to the beginning of Q. The pushed address A is referred to as the **return address** and is computed as the address of the instruction immediately following the call instruction*

### 3.7.4 Local Storage on the Stack
```c

long call_proc() {
  long  x1 = 1;
  int   x2 = 2;
  short x3 = 3;
  char  x4 = 4;

  proc(x1, &x1, x2, &x2, x3, &x3, x4, &x4);
  return (x1 + x2) * (x3 - x4);
}
```

movq    $1,       24(%rsp)
movl    $2,       20(%rsp)

### 3.7.6 Recursive Procedures
```c
long rfact(long n) {
  long result;

  if(n <= 1)
    result = 1;
  else
    result = n * rfact(n - 1);
  return result;
}
```

rfact:
  pushq   %rbx
  movq    %rdi,     %rbx
  movl    $1,       %eax
  cmpq    $1,       %rdi
  jle     .L35
  leaq    -1(%rdi)  %rdi
  call    rfact
  imulq   %rbx,     %rax
.L35:
  popq    %rbx
  ret
