Our second case in the HCL code for d_valA uses signal e_dstE to see whether
to select the ALU output e_valE as the forwarding source. Suppose instead that
we use signal E_dstE, the destination register ID in pipeline register E for this
selection. Write a Y86-64 program that would give an incorrect result with this
modified forwarding logic.

E_dstE = icode && rB

E_dstE = [
  icode in { IPOPQ, IPUSHQ, } : %rsp
  icode in { IOP, IRRMOVQ, IIRMOVQ } : rB
]
