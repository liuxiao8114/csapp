Practice Problem 4.40
Write HCL code for the signal E_bubble in the PIPE implementation.

Practice Problem 4.41
Write HCL code for the signal set_cc in the PIPE implementation. This should
only occur for OPq instructions, and should consider the effects of program exceptions.

bool set_cc = [
  e_stat in {} : 000;
  e_icode == 6
]

Practice Problem 4.42
Write HCL code for the signals M_bubble and W_stall in the PIPE implementation.
The latter signal requires modifying the exception condition listed in Figure
4.64.
