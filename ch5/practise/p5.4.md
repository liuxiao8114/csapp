Inner loop of combine3. data_t = double, OP = *. Compiled -O2
dest in %rbx, data+i in %rdx, data+length in %rax
Accumulated product in %xmm0

.L22: loop:
vmulsd (%rdx), %xmm0, %xmm0 Multiply product by data[i]
addq $8, %rdx               Increment data+i
cmpq %rax, %rdx             Compare to data+length
vmovsd %xmm0, (%rbx)        Store product at dest
jne .L22                    If !=, goto loop


.L17: loop:
vmovsd (%rbx), %xmm0        Read product from dest
vmulsd (%rdx), %xmm0, %xmm0 Multiply product by data[i]
vmovsd %xmm0, (%rbx)        Store product at dest
addq   $8, %rdx             Increment data + i
cmpq   %rax, %rdx           Compare to data + length
jne    .L17                 If !=, goto loop

We see that, besides some reordering of instructions, the only difference is that
the more optimized version does not contain the vmovsd implementing the read
from the location designated by dest (line 2).
A. How does the role of register %xmm0 differ in these two loops?

The %xmm0 in -O2 performs as accumulator while
the %xmm0 in -O1 is only an intermate value saving the *dest   

B. Will the more optimized version faithfully implement the C code of combine3,
including when there is memory aliasing between dest and the vector data?

Yes, because the %xmm0 is written back to the memory in the loop.

C. Either explain why this optimization preserves the desired behavior, or give
an example where it would produce different results than the less optimized
code.
